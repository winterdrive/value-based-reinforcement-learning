# Technical Report: Value-Based Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This technical report presents the implementation and evaluation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms for value-based reinforcement learning. The project includes implementations for both discrete control tasks (CartPole) and Atari games with visual observations (Pong). The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of various DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, double DQN, and multi-step learning.

## 1. Implementation Details

### Core DQN Components

The implementation is built around several key components in `src/dqn_core.py`:

#### Neural Network Architectures

**CartPole DQN Network:**

- Input: 4-dimensional state vector (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity)
- Architecture: Fully connected layers (4 → 256 → 256 → 128 → 2)
- Output: Q-values for 2 discrete actions (left, right)

**Atari DQN Network:**

- Input: 84×84×4 preprocessed grayscale frames
- Architecture: Convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers
  - Conv2d(4, 32, 8, 4) → ReLU
  - Conv2d(32, 64, 4, 2) → ReLU  
  - Conv2d(64, 64, 3, 1) → ReLU
  - Flatten → Linear(3136, 512) → ReLU
  - Linear(512, num_actions)

#### Experience Replay Systems

**Standard Experience Replay:**

- Fixed-size circular buffer storing (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuples
- Random sampling for training to break temporal correlations
- Configurable buffer size (10,000 for CartPole, 100,000 for Atari)

**Prioritized Experience Replay (PER):**

- Samples transitions based on their temporal difference (TD) error magnitude
- Uses importance sampling to correct for bias introduced by non-uniform sampling
- Implements alpha (prioritization exponent) and beta (importance sampling correction) parameters
- Provides significant sample efficiency improvements in sparse reward environments
